# Anti-Debugging

NetBeauty provides a `--enabledebug` option to prevent debugging the app, it removes the `mscordaccore` and `mscordbi` libs and won't be able to init the debugger anymore, this just can prevent limited groups of crackers, you should add more static protections and runtime protections using professional software-protection tools.
